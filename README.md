# Knights-Tour

This project is made to solve the Knight's Tour problem for
varying sizes of boards using a brute force approach carried
out by multithreading. It will utilize the built-in
multithreading in C. 


Compile using "gcc -Wall -Werror hw3-main.c hw3.c -pthread"

A good first test is "a.out 3 4 0 0"


This project was created for Operational Systems at RPI, Spring
2022.
